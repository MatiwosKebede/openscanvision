# CONTRIBUTING – OpenScanVision Contributor Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to OpenScanVision! We welcome bug reports, feature requests, documentation improvements, and code contributions.

## How to Contribute
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or fix:
   ```
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. Make your changes following the guidelines below.
4. Test your changes thoroughly on a physical device (or emulator with camera).
5. Commit with a clear and descriptive message.
6. Push to your fork and open a Pull Request against the `main` branch.

## Code Style
- **Kotlin**: Follow the official Kotlin coding conventions (IntelliJ default).
- **Compose**: Prefer `@Composable` functions over classes; keep UI logic separate from business logic.
- **Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- **Comments**: Add KDoc comments for public APIs and explain non‑obvious logic.

## Testing
- Unit tests for utility functions (e.g., `ImagePreprocessor`, `ScannerUtils`) are encouraged.
- Manual testing with printed cards is essential for OMR changes.
- If you add a new card template, include a sample QR code and test it.

## Reporting Issues
- Use the GitHub issue tracker.
- Provide a clear description, steps to reproduce, device model, Android version, and if possible, a screenshot or logcat output.

## Feature Requests
- Open an issue with the label `enhancement`.
- Describe the use case and why it would benefit the project.

## Pull Request Checklist
Before submitting your PR, ensure:
- [ ] Code compiles and runs without errors.
- [ ] All existing features still work (no regressions).
- [ ] New features are documented in the appropriate files (README, code comments).
- [ ] No unnecessary debug logs or commented code remain.
- [ ] Your commit history is clean (squash if needed).
